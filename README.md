# LanguageRecognition
Language Recognition using supervised learning. Recognizes german, english and spanish.

A description of all of the parts of the NeuralNet can be found in my NeuralNet project. 

This works well with single words, and works almost perfectly with a sentence. Requires about 10,000ish trains to be really accurate.
